I had a schnapsidee of taking my bratwurst to a nice date night to the biergarten.
I put on my best lederhose letting them blow in the klimaanlage.
After dinner my date, Schnewwittchen, and I took the BMW up the Hauptstrasse.
We were on our way to the Music festival with Rammstein as the headlining band.
Unfortunately, there was a traffic jam near the Flughafen, and the car's Klimaanlage seemed to have stopped working.
And, all of the sudden we found ourselves in a Ratskeller in Berlin
The Klimaanlage made the Einkaufszentrum feel like a Luftschloss
After our stop at the Ratskellar we went to a nearby Einkaufszentrum. So, Schnewwittchen and I began a quest for die Armbanduhr.
